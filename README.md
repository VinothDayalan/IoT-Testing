# Iot Pentesting ( VAPT )

Welcome to my IoT Pentesting (VAPT) GitHub repository, where i offer helpful information and instruments to assist security experts in conducting thorough security analyses of IoT devices and networks.

A variety of helpful tools are available in our repository, including penetration testing scripts, attack frameworks, and vulnerability scanners tailored specifically for IoT setups. These tools can assist you in locating security flaws and potential attack routes, giving you the opportunity to proactively fix any vulnerabilities before they are used against you.

I offer a multitude of materials and information on IoT security in addition to the solutions, such as best practises, security standards, and actual case studies. This repository is a great tool to help you stay on top of the latest developments and maintain the security of your IoT networks, whether you're an experienced security professional or just getting started with IoT security like me.

I invite you to peruse my repository and utilise the tools and information i provide. I also appreciate community contributions, so if you have a tool or resource that you believe would be beneficial to other IoT security experts, feel free to add it to This repository. We can improve the IoT's security and reliability by working together.
